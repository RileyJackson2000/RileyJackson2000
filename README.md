  <p>âš¡ Fun fact: Profile README's can't access other files in their repo. For example, this picture works</p>
  <img style="width:100%" src="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/rjackson2000.com/lighthousebanner.jpg">
  <p>because it's a hard coded link but this one doesn't</p>
  <img style="width:100%" src="lighthousebanner.jpg">
  <p>because it's a local link, even though they both work on the repo <a href="https://www.github.com/RileyJackson2000/RileyJackson2000">README</a>.</p>
